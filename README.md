# Intoduction to pyAuto

PyAuto is a colabrative effort to devlope a python library to automate the borring parts of using test test eqipment. So Engineers can focus on the otherwise thrilling aspects of using test eqipment.  PyAuto is essentually two semi related libraries.  The core PyAuto libary will detect and export a list of connected eqipment as a **Bench** object.  The **Bench** object can then be pased to a **TestPlan** object.  **TestPlan** is an abstract class out outlining and running a series of measuments.

### Motivation
PyAuto came about as a sanity project mechanism while working in a test and devlopment envrioment.  Often Engineers will have to excutute repetive and time consuming settings on insturments.  This is an exspensive and error prone proccess, and often the goal of these measuments is to capture repetive data or to excutue a unit test.  By providing a simple way to automate these tasks PyAuto hopes to help Engineers achive a high quality of life, and possibly a longer duration of sanity. 
  

- ### Bench usage 

- ### TestPlan usage

- ### Example: pulling in a list of connected devices using bench 

- ### Example: Reading traces from an oscope using Bench

- ### Example: Using TestPlan to run a list of measuments
